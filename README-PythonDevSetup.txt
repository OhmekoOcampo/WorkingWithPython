==> Two Ways to Install Python: 

Way 1) Install on your local machine. 

Installing the Anaconda Distribution (One way to install Python), Anaconda Distribution contains
Python as well as other installed libraries including the Jupyter Notebook Environment.

Step 1) Go to www.anaconda.com/downloads and install the Anaconda Installer it should look
something like: Anaconda3-2021.11-Windows-x86_64.exe. On docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/ 
you can find step by step instruction on how to install Anaconda Installer.

Step 2) Double click the Anaconda installer you download on step 1, and make sure you check under 
Advanced Options "Add Anaconda3 to my Path environment variable" if you are going to use Anaconda as
your main way you will run Python code. You can invoke Anaconda on your Windows Command Line. 

Step 3) In this setup we will be using the Anaconda and Jyupter Notebooks since it's the most accessible
for first time Python programmers. Once the Anaconda Navigator shows up click "jupyter notebook" and begin. 

Step 4) It should open your default browser you set on Windows. Recommended to use Google Chrome.

Step 5) Using jyupter notebook, navigate to a folder you want to place your first Python working folder in.
Click new > Folder

Step 6) Create a new jyupter notebook by selecting new > Python3


Way 2) No Installation, Run Python directly in the browser.

jupyter.org/try
Google Collab Online Notebooks
Repl.it
Google Search: "Python Interpreter Online"

==> 3 Main Types of Environments you can work with Python. 
Text Editors
Full IDEs
Notebook Environments

Matlab programmers, use Spyder as your IDE for python. 

==> How run your .py script. 
Way 1)
C:\> python myexample.py

Way 2) 
C:\> python

>>> <type your python statements here>

You can exit out of the python interpreter by quit()

==> How to run your jyputer notebooks 
Create a notebook, then type your python statements. You will then save on your system an .ipynb jyupter 
notebook. 

You can run a cell by clicking the Run button at the top, it's an icon near the stop. 
Shift + Enter also will run a cell. 

If you want to create a non-code cell select on the dropdown "Markdown" instead of "Code"

NEED SOME PRACTICE PROBLEMS?

Before you begin your assessment, I wanted to point out some helpful links for practice (don't worry about being able to do these exercises, I just want you to be aware of the links so you can visit them later, since we still haven't discussed functions, you won't be able to utilize a lot of these resources yet!):
